Lesson 4 – Recursion - Lab Homework

Find the solutions for the given problem using recursive approach.
1. Merge the two sorted string into a single sorted string.

Note : Your input should be a sorted input string.
Example : String1 = “ ace ”
 String2 = “ bdf ”
 Output : “ abcdef ”
 
2. Using recursion to find the minimum character in a given string input.
If your input is “akel” in return ‘a’

3. Perform Recursive Binary Search.

4. Check the given string input is palindrome or not.

5. Write a Junit Test case to test any of the above two problems
