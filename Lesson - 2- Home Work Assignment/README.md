Problem - 1

Create a class called Prog1. In the main method of the class, output to the console the result of doing the following two computations:
1. get a random number x in the range 1 .. 9 and compute πx.
2. get a random number y in the range 3 .. 14 and compute yπ.
Use the RandomNumbers.java class that has been provided for you as an attachment. (Do not use the Random class directly.) Use Math API to solve πx and yπ.

Problem – 2

Create a class Prog2. Inside its main method, create float variables to store each of the following numbers:
1.27, 3.881, 9.6
Output to the console the following two values:
1. the sum of the floats as an integer, obtained by casting the sum to type int
2. the sum of the floats as an integer, obtained by rounding the sum to the nearest integer, using the Math.round function
